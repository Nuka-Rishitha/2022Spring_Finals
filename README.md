**_The Influence of Imports and Exports of a Country on the GDP_**

**Created By:** Aayusha Sheregar and Nuka Rishitha

**Goal:** The goal of this project is to understand whether the exporting and importing activities of a country affects its GDP with the help of data analysis.


**HYPOTHESIS 1:**

**Article used:**  https://www.jagranjosh.com/general-knowledge/list-of-top-10-export-and-import-source-of-india-1584105230-1

"As per the article, India is in a trade deficit with China since the past 10 years, but does this affect its GDP?”

Trade deficit is the amount by which the cost of a country's imports exceeds the value of its exports. GDP is the total value of goods produced and services provided in a country during one year. This hypothesis explores if the 10 year long trade deficit with China impacts India's GDP. 


**HYPOTHESIS 2:**

"Do ALL countries with a trade deficit for past 10 years in a row have a direct effect on their GDP?"

This hypothesis is an expansion of hypothesis 1 and dives further into proving whether trade deficit in ALL countries impacts it's GDP.


**HYPOTHESIS 3:**

"Did the global demand slow down and fall in crude oil prices during the period 2014-16 affect India’s exports of mineral fuel?"

The world saw a global demand slowdown and reduction in crude oil prices in the year 2014. Since India's highest exported product is Mineral Fuels, with the help of this hypothesis we wanted to dig deeper and understand how both these situations have had an effect on the exporting trends of India from the year 2014-2016.

Contributions:
Both of us worked together in formulating and testing the Hypothesis-1 and also played an equal part in preparing the Presentation. 
Rishitha worked on the idea and code for Hypothesis -2. Aayusha worked on the idea and code for Hypothesis-3.
